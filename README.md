# ARU


**English** - [Русский][ru]

This is an assistant for tuning your Arch Linux system to get the best
performance and customize your system for comfortable gaming.  Here you can
also find guides on how to optimize your system.  The project does not pretend
to replace Arch Wiki, it is only a practical guide written from the authors'
personal experience.

## About the two repositories

The project was originally hosted on GitHub, but at some point it moved to Codeberg and is
still developing there. Nevertheless, the repository on GitHub didn't disappear and
is essentially just a mirror for Codeberg. If you want to contribute to
project, it's best to submit changes to the Codeberg repository. The domain
https://ventureoo.github.io/ARU is saved and redirects you to the actual address.

## How can I contribute to the project?

The project is not in its most active phase at the moment, but I'm still
willing to accept any edits to improve the written material or
adding new sections. Please, if you would like to contribute.

At the beginning:

1) Open a issue in our Codeberg repository (https://codeberg.org/ventureo/ARU, registration required)
2) Or create a Pull Request and submit it to our Codeberg repository.

If you choose the second option, you will need to know how to work with files
in the ReStructuredText (ReST) format. This is where all the sections you can
find in ``docs/source/``. I recommend that you study the following materials
before you start making your edits:

https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html

https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/index.html

The easiest way to get your edits in the ARU, for "dummies" in Git, so to speak,
is to use the web interface on Codeberg to edit it. There you can also
you can check your changes to make sure they are correct and true.

Only after the author has reviewed and merged your edits will they be available in the web
ARU version (https://ventureo.codeberg.page/).
